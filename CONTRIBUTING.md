2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure the syle of your code is consistent with that of the current one (indentation, etc.).
4. If you've changed any relevant functionalities, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the application is working correctly. (Run `devtools::test()` for quick tests, and eventually also `devtools::check(args = '--run-donttest')`.)
6. Issue that pull request.
