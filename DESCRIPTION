Description: This R package serves to calculate, via simulation, power and
  appropriate stopping alpha boundaries (and including, optionally, futility
  bounds) for sequential analyses (i.e., group sequential design), given any
  specified global error rate. This enables the sequential use of practically
  any significance test, as long as the underlying data can be simulated in
  advance to a reasonable approximation. Note: Since the specific functions are
  rather complex, it is much easier to understand the procedure with the
  examples given via https://github.com/gasparl/possa.
