Description: This R package serves to calculate, via simulation, power and
  appropriate stopping alpha boundaries (and including, optionally, futility
  bounds) for sequential analyses (i.e., group sequential design) as well as for
  multiple hypotheses (i.e., multiple p values being evaluated), given any
  specified global error rate. This enables the sequential and/or concurrent use
  of practically any significance test(s), as long as the underlying data can be
  simulated in advance to a reasonable approximation. Note: Since the specific
  functions' details are rather complex, it is much easier to understand the
  procedure with the examples given via https://github.com/gasparl/possa. URL:
