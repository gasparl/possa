\title{Simulation procedure}
\usage{
sim(f_sample, n_obs, f_test, n_iter = 1000, seed = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_sample}{Function. create any sample variables; use list for varying factors and indicate different parameters in the list elements (as number vectors)}

\item{n_obs}{A number, a numeric vector, or a list of numeric vectors. (Any of the numbers can always be \code{NA} values as well.)
Specifies samples sizes for any sample variable from f_sample that is to be used in f_test. H1 and H2 has to be specified with "_h" ending, then it's converted to "_h0" and "_h1".}

\item{f_test}{Function. Uses as input the sample variables created in f_sample AND specified in n_obs. The obtained p values must be specified with "p_" start and "_h0" and "_h1" endings (e.g., p_h0, p_h1; p_ttest_h0, p_ttest_h1).}

\item{n_iter}{Number of iterations.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{\link{data.frame}}, etc.
}
\description{
This function performs the simulation procedure in order to get p
 values. The sample is simulated via the given \code{f_sample} function, and
 the significance test is performed via the given \code{f_test} function. The
 numbers of observations per look (for a sequential design) are specified in
 \code{n_obs}.
